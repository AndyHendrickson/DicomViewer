Software License Agreement for Add-on Software Components
from 3Dim Laboratory s.r.o.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you (either an 
individual or an entity) and 3Dim Laboratory s.r.o. ("3Dim Laboratory")
for the software product ("Software") with which this Agreement is 
provided, including associated media, printed materials, and online or 
electronic documentation. The term "Software" also shall include any 
updates or modified versions of the Software provided to you by 3Dim 
Laboratory.

The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property 
laws and by international treaties. The Software is licensed, not 
sold. By copying, installing or using all or any portion of the 
Software you accept all the terms and conditions of this agreement. If 
you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the 
Software.

Add-on Components
--
The Software is an add-on component (i.e. "Plugin") extending 
functionality of other software with its own license. The Plugin is 
distributed separately, as a different product, under this Agreement. 
You may install and use the Plugin solely as part of, and in conjunction 
with, the software the Plugin was designed for. You may not use the 
Plugin in any other manner, including using it with any other 
application. This Agreement doesn't qualify you for using the software
for which the Plugin was designed.

Grant of License
--
With a single license of the Software, the Software may either be 
installed and used by a single person who uses the Software personally 
on one or more computers (e.g. one installation at home and one at the 
office used by the same person, or installed on a single workstation 
and used no simultaneously by multiple people, but not 
both.

With multiple licenses of the Software, the Software may be installed 
on multiple computers or accessed through a network, provided that at 
any time you may have as many copies of the Software in use as you 
have licenses. Furthermore you and your employees (up to the number of 
licenses you have) may install and use the Software at home.

The standard license includes the right to use all components bundled 
with Software except components with their own license.

Expiration Date
--
The Agreement may be time limited. On the expiration or termination of 
this Agreement, you will cease using the Software, 3Dim Laboratory may 
cease making updates available to you, and the Software may cease 
functioning. The software may contain a time out feature that will 
render the software inoperative at the end of the expiration 
date.

Renewals
--
3Dim Laboratory, may offer you the opportunity to extend the license 
granted by this Agreement at current renewal prices.

Evaluation License
--
3Dim Laboratory also provides an evaluation license ("Trial License"). 
Using the Trial License you may install and use the Software to test 
and evaluate for 30 days. Following this test period of 30 days, you 
must obtain a license (if you wish to continue to use the Software) or 
uninstall the Software.

Additional License Terms
--
The evaluation version of the Software, may be freely distributed, 
provided the distribution package is not modified. You may not charge 
any fee for the copy or use of the evaluation Software itself, but you 
may charge a distribution fee that is reasonably related to any cost 
you incur distributing the evaluation Software (e.g. media, packaging).
You must not represent in any way that you are licensing or selling 
the Software itself. Your distribution of the evaluation Software will 
not entitle you to any compensation from 3Dim 
Laboratory.

Third Party Components
--
The software may contain also several third party components, 
including open source components, which are provided and licensed to 
you under the terms and conditions of the respective third party 
licenses (see 3rdparty.txt).

Backup Copy
--
You may make a reasonable number of backup copies of the Software, 
provided your backup copies are not installed or used for other than 
archival purposes.

Resctrictions on Use
--
You may not use, copy, emulate, clone, lease, sell, rent, sublicense, 
lend, modify, decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or 
transfer the Software, or any subset of the Software, except as 
provided for in this Agreement. Provided that you have obtained 
license of the Software, you may transfer all your rights to use the 
Software to another person or legal entity provided (a) that you 
transfer this Agreement, the Software, including all copies, updates 
and prior versions to such person or entity, (b) that you retain no 
copies, including copies stored on a computer, and (c) that the 
receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement.

Exclusion of Other Warranties
--
Except as provided above, the software is provided "as is" without any 
express or implied warranty of any kind, including warranties of 
merchantability, noninfringement, or fitness for a particular purpose. 
You have ensured by using the above mentioned evaluation version that 
the Software works according to your requirements and the advertised 
features. You acknowledge that software cannot be completely 
error-free.

Limitation of Liability
--
In no event shall 3Dim Laboratory or its suppliers be liable for any 
damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, lost profits, 
business interruption or lost information) arising out of the use of 
or inability to use the Software, even if 3Dim Laboratory has been 
advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall 3Dim 
Laboratory's or its suppliers' total cumulative liability to you 
arising from this agreement exceed the amount actually paid by you for 
the Software.

Some jurisdictions prohibit exclusion or limitation of liability for 
implied warranties or consequential or incidental damages, so the 
above limitation may not apply to you. You may also have other legal 
rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Termination of Agreement
--
3Dim Laboratory, in addition to such other rights may be available at 
law or equity, shall be entitled to terminate the license granted by 
this Agreement without liability for cause at any time without notice 
if you commit a material breach of this Agreement. On the termination 
of this Agreement, you will cease using the Software.
