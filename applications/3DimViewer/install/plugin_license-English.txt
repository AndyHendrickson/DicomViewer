============================================================

This is a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you (either an 
individual or an entity) and 3Dim Laboratory s.r.o. ("3Dim Laboratory")
for the software product ("Software") with which this Agreement is 
provided, including associated media, printed materials, and online or

The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property 
laws and by international treaties. The Software is licensed, not 
sold. By copying, installing or using all or any portion of the 
Software you accept all the terms and conditions of this agreement. If 
you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the

Add-on Components
--
The Software is an add-on component (i.e. "Plugin") extending 
functionality of other software with its own license. The Plugin is 
distributed separately, as a different product, under this Agreement. 
You may install and use the Plugin solely as part of, and in conjunction 
with, the software the Plugin was designed for. You may not use the 
Plugin in any other manner, including using it with any other 
application. This Agreement doesn't qualify you for using the software
for which the Plugin was designed.

Grant of License
--
With a single license of the Software, the Software may either be 
installed and used by a single person who uses the Software personally 
on one or more computers (e.g. one installation at home and one at the 
office used by the same person, or installed on a single workstation 
and used no simultaneously by multiple people, but not 
both.

With multiple licenses of the Software, the Software may be installed 
on multiple computers or accessed through a network, provided that at 
any time you may have as many copies of the Software in use as you 
have licenses. Furthermore you and your employees (up to the number of 
licenses you have) may install and use the Software at home.

The standard license includes the right to use all components bundled 
with Software except components with their own license.

this Agreement, you will cease using the Software, 3Dim Laboratory may 
cease making updates available to you, and the Software may cease 
functioning. The software may contain a time out feature that will 
render the software inoperative at the end of the expiration 
date.

may charge a distribution fee that is reasonably related to any cost 
you incur distributing the evaluation Software (e.g. media, packaging).
You must not represent in any way that you are licensing or selling 
the Software itself. Your distribution of the evaluation Software will 
not entitle you to any compensation from 3Dim 
Laboratory.

including open source components, which are provided and licensed to 
you under the terms and conditions of the respective third party
